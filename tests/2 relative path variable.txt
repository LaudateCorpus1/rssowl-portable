What is being tested:
1. The correct use of the -data switch (RSSOwl.ini file)
2. RSSOwls behavior for saving data
see Bug #2 for details: https://github.com/rssowl/rssowl-portable/issues/2

Setup:
1. Copy RSSOwlPortable (the folder) to a random folder on local disk
2. make sure that only one single “installation” of RSSOwlPortable is available
	on the currently tested system
3. run RSSOwl, modify some data, add feeds, …
4. close RSSOwl (make sure to close, not minimize to tray)
5. check the error log (see http://www.rssowl.org/help#item_5 for details) on errors
6. move the RSSOwlPortable somewhere else, including
	* a thumb drive
	* a different folder on local disk
	* a different PC (with thumb drive)
	* a different PC (local disk)
	and repeat 3./4./5.

This test case is passed if RSSOwls data (Database, Preferences, …) is consistent
over all different locations it is being checked and there are no errors related
to moving the RSSOwlPortable folder.
